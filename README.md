The objective of the project is to design and implement an application simulating customer queues and their processing. It involves generating random arrival and service times for each customer, calculating their waiting time, and distributing them efficiently among available service points. The graphical interface allows users to input parameters such as arrival and service time ranges, the number of customers, and available service points.
